                During my side job in a soap manufacory I discovered my passion 
                for Webdevelopment and Webdesign. I was supported by my family and friends to make my passion my profession.
                Therefore I started working on private projects but I soon realized that I would not be able to do it without 
                professional support besides my full time job as business intelligence consultant.
                <br>
                <br>
                So I decided to become a Frontend Developer and take professional training to reach my goal. 
                Here I have worked both on my own and in a team on various projects. 
                This intensive training allowed me to quickly gain experience and deepen my knowledge.
                <br> 
                <br> 
                Here I am and I am looking forward to continuing my developer career with a job in a junior web
                developer position. If you think I&#8217;d be a good match for your projects, please do not hesitate to contact me!
