                    I am a 27-year-old frontend developer with experience in developing 
                    web applications with JavaScript & Angular. So far I have worked as business intelligence consultant 
                    acquiring skills in SQL, MDX and database administration. However, i realized at a certain point, that my 
                    passion lies with in web development - here is my story:

            <div data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-offset="200" class="width-90 d-flex text-container">
                <img src="../../assets/icons/profile/idea.png" alt="Idea">
                <p>
                    During my side job in a soap manufacory I discovered my passion 
                    for web development and web design while working on the new webshop. I was supported by my family and friends to make my passion my profession.
                    Therefore I started working on private projects but I soon realized that I would not be able to do it without 
                    professional support besides my full time job as consultant.

                <p>
                    So I decided to become a frontend developer and take professional training to reach my goal. 
                    Here I have worked both on my own and in a team on various projects. 
                    This intensive training allowed me to quickly gain experience and deepen my knowledge.

                    Here I am and I am looking forward to continuing my developer career with a job in a junior web
                    developer position. If you think I&#8217;d be a good match for your projects, please do not hesitate to contact me!
